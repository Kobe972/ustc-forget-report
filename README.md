## Introduction
What if you forget the fucking cross-campus report? **Ooooooops!** This repository can help you. The only thing you need to do is uploading index.html to your school FTP server. If you open the website, you can see the page about the reporting result. Regardless of whether you remember to report this day, the first column of the chart shows the successful result of the day.
